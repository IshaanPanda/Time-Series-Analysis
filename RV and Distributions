Random Variables is a mapping from outcomes to numbers. 
Perform an experiment, in case the output is not a number, assign the outcomes a numeric value and know the probabiltiy of each outcome.
To characterize a random variable, we need:
the values it cn take; and 
the probability distribution of those values
Types:
1. Discrete: take a finite or a countable number of values. Countable could mean infintite but can be counted
Examples:
- Number of visits does twitter get in a year. Can be infintie number of visits, there is no limit to the views it can get. But the views can always be counted.
- Dummy varibles in a regression (take value 0 or 1)
- Listing out discrete RV's= {1,2,3,4,5,6}
2. Continuous: take an uncountable number of values. 
Examples: 
- Stock prices, returns, interest rates, annual sales
- Strictly speaking these variables are discrete. Since stock prices would increase in increments of 1 cent
- or interest rates for banks would change at base of 0.01%. These quantities can be counted but for modeling purposes we treat them as a continuous process.
- Listing out continuous RV's= Can take any value between 0 and 1

Distribution- lists out the values a random variable can take and describes the associated probabilities.

Simplest random variable in the discrete case:
Beroulli Distribution: 
Bernoulli Random Variable can only take two values: 0 and 1
P[X=1]=p and P[X=0]=1-p; Therefore, P[X=x]=p^x*(1-p)^(1-x) for x:{0 or 1} 

Binomial Distribution:
Binomial Distribution is the sum of n independent Bernoulli random variables.
P[Y=y]= 12Cy* p^y *(1-p)^12-y

Simplest random variable in the continuous case:
Uniform Distribution:
Bernoulli Random Variable can take any value between -1 and 1 and has no preference.
In continous random variables can take an uncountable number of values. Since we cannot count them, we cannot list them and hence addition of probabilities 
of values he RV can take does not makes sense. We talk about windows or ranges in case of contnuous random variables
P[-1<=X<=1]=1
